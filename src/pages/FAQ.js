        <h4>What is this?</h4>
        <p>Tweet Your Bracket allows you to enter your NCAA Tournament picks using only your Twitter account. Compete against all of Twitter with just a tweet.</p>
        <p><em>/end-elevatorpitch</em> For reals though, I love brackets so I built a bracket challenge site so I could add all the features I've ever wanted. If you also love (or even just like) brackets, you'll probably have a good time here.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Why do I have to tweet my entry?</h4>
        <p>It started as a bit of a gimmick because I wanted to test <a target='_blank' href='https://gist.github.com/lukekarrys/2028007#why'>if you could fit a serialized NCAA tournament bracket in a tweet</a>. It stuck around because I think it's fun to share your picks on Twitter.</p>
        <p>It also has the added bonus that in case someone submits a perfect bracket, I can point to the original tweet in case someone thinks some random little bracket challenge site forged a perfect bracket for the publicity.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Can I delete my tweet after I enter?</h4>
        <p>Technically yes, but I'd prefer if you didn't ðŸ˜„ (meaning that you will still be entered on the site even if your tweet no longer exists). But just think about how you'd want the tweet as proof if you ever filled out a perfect bracket!</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>How many times can I enter?</h4>
        <p>Once per Twitter account. If you want to change your entry, just tweet a new bracket from the same account. In fact, you can tweet as many entries as you want from a single account, but only the latest entry will be used as your official one.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Can I enter with a private Twitter account?</h4>
        <p>At this time, only entries from public Twitter accounts will work.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>How are entries scored?</h4>
        <p>Each round is worth a maximum of 320 points, so each game is worth (320 / number of games in that round). This has the effect of making games in later rounds worth more than earlier rounds.</p>

        <p>Entries are also scored using the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704507404576178923020853478'>Gooley Scoring Method</a>. This is mostly for fun because it makes it easy to see <Link to='/ncaam-2014/entries?sort=gooley%7Cdesc'>who picked the best upsets</Link> or <Link to='/ncaam-2014/entries?game=0&sort=gooleyPPR%7Cdesc'>who had the most potential madness in their bracket at the start</Link>, but it is also used as the tiebreaker.</p>

        <h4>Who made this?</h4>
        <p>Hey, thanks for asking! I'm <a target='_blank' href='http://lukekarrys.com/'>Luke</a>. I've always been into code and brackets, so I was bound to make something like this eventually. A bunch of it is open source, so if you're into that sort of thing, you can <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/tweetyourbracket'>check it out on GitHub</a>. You can get in touch <a target='_blank' href={`mailto:luke@lukekarrys.com?${qs.stringify({subject: 'Tweet Your Bracket FAQ'})}`}>via email</a> if there's something bracket related you want to chat about.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>How does it work? Why did you make this?</h4>
        <p>I talked about those things and a few others over on <a target='_blank' href='http://lukecod.es/categories/tweet-your-bracket/'>my code blog</a>, so you should check that out if you're really curious.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Will you remind me when to enter?</h4>
        <p>Of course! <Link to='subscribe'>Sign up for the newsletter</Link> and I'll let you know when brackets open and some other infrequent updates like when I add cool stuff to the site.</p>
